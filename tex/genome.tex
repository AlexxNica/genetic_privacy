\begin{abstract}
The right of a person to control his or her own data is a fundamental tenet of privacy advocacy today. This position implicitly assumes the {\em possibility} of such control, at least with the co-operation of the powers that be -- broadly, the government, and those involved in data collection and analysis.

In the context of genetic data, it is well known that each person shares genetic material with blood relatives, and that the extent of sharing is dependent upon the degree of the relationship. Given this fact, how does the notion of an ``owner'' of each piece of data hold up? Does it merely need to be modified, or jettisoned entirely, thus necessitating an overhaul of the genetic privacy debate?

We show that the answer is likely to be disturbingly close to the latter possibility. The key to our conclusion is an analysis of what an adversary, equipped with realistic ``auxiliary information,'' might be able to deduce from completely anonymous genetic material -- for instance, pieces of hair collected {\em en masse} from public spaces without the consent, or even the {\em knowledge}, of the potential victims. We qualify and quantify the conditions under which identities can be affixed to these surreptitiously collected samples, and argue that these conditions will become a reality within a few short years.

There does not appear to be a purely technological fix to our attack. We briefly present policy prescriptions that may delay the eventuality of genetic re-identifiability, and argue that genetic privacy norms must change to accomodate the new technological reality.

\section{Introduction}

Threats to genetic privacy have been of great concern to society every since the dawn of DNA fingerprinting. However, the availability of cheap genotyping in the last few years has changed the scale of the threat so much as to make it qualitatively different. For instance, at the time of this writing, a ``personal genomics'' kit costs \$399 \cite{23-and-me} and has been estimated to capture over 50\% of the entropy in the human genome.

Privacy violations could take many forms, including data breaches and sharing of information without consent. We are concerned about {\em inference attacks}, which result in unexpected revelation of sensitive facts about individuals from data or samples that might at first glance appear to hide the facts in question.

Inference attacks have recently received considerable attention: in 2007, Homer {\em et al} showed that the identities of individuals contributing DNA to a mixture, by analyzing only the {\em aggregate} values of each genotype locus. Further papers have discussed this attack, arguing that it is either less serious \cite{sriram} or more serious \cite{css} than previously thought.  In other work, Goodrich analyzed threats to the privacy of mitochondrial DNA sequences \cite{goodrich}.

Common to these attacks is the fact that the victim needs to have first given up their DNA or genotype data. On the other hand, we consider the question of what an adversary can learn from a completely anonymous genetic sample -- for instance, pieces of hair collected {\em en masse} from public spaces without the consent, or even the {\em knowledge}, of the potential victims.

 Our analysis rests on the assumption that two types of data will become available to powerful adversaries within at most a decade or two: 
\begin{itemize}
\item
1) a {\em genealogical graph} consisting of an increasingly large fraction of all known blood relationships among all individuals
\item
2) {\em genotypes} of a small fraction of the individuals represented in the above graph
\end{itemize}

Algorithms to identify shared --``identical-by-descent''-- genetic sequences even among distantly related individuals have recently been developed. This enables the adversary, with some confidence, to detect familial relationships. Our main technical contribution is an algorithm which uses the above data to determine,
