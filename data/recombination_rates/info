Centimorgan is defined as the genetic distance such that the expected number of recombinations is 0.01
ie, 0.01 = x * p, where x is in bases. Thus 1 cM = x = 1 / (p * 100) bases

We want to go from probability to base, that is p/b. So to go from cM / Mb to p / b
we multiply by (p * 100) / 1 Mb = (p * 100) / 10 ** 6 = p / (10 ** 4)
