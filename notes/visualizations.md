We want a graph with % of labeled genotypes on the x axis and $ of labeled 4th degree cousins or closer on the y axis. This could be a good proxy for deanonamization. The graph should give us an idea of how many genomes we need labeled for deanonymization to succeed.

We want a graph with degree of relation on the x axis and average cM shared on the y axis. Could use something other than average for y axis.
