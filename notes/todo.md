* Don't use naive bayes to determine relatedness at first. Instead use total length of shared segments. Only use bayes later if it gives better results.
* Use naive bayes / likelikhood maximizaion on vector of relatedness to determine the individual.
* Look at the distributions of relationships that have the same relationship vector but are different in nature.
