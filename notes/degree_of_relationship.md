n-th cousin doesn't work well because it doesn't map onto every
pairwise relationship cleanly, ie as a single number.

Degree of relationship isn't great either, as pair who share
significantly more genes may be assigned the same degree of
relationship as pairs who share less. For example full siblings and
half sibling have the same degree of relationship even though they
share 50% and 25% of their genes, respectively.

We could try bucketing based on kinship coefficient.
