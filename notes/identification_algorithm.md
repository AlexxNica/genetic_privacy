We can't learn for each individual what their feature vector will look like, but we can learn in general how much the *difference* between the genealogically derived relatedness measure and the genetically derived relatedness measure can differ for each individual.

This means we perform training and identification on |<genealogical vector> - <genetic vector>|. This should in theory allow us to learn the reliability of each feature too.
