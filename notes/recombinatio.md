Types of recombination
----------------------
There are two types of recombination, cross over recombination (CO) and non cross over recombination (NCO).
Non cross over recombination doesn't seem to have an effect linkage disequlibrium.
Cross over recombination happens most often between homologous chromosomes.
NCO seems to be more common the cross over recombination.

Is this reflected in the hapmap data?

Recombination may vary person to person, not just by sex: http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000831
